If you want to access the `todo-panel` widget, I suggest you take a look at this particular commit [particular commit](https://github.com/osmarmora05/dotfiles/tree/a30281c92ea9e78e96c609c5c558e3e45e79f367). I decided to remove this widget because I personally don't use it, also it has problems when used with dual monitors, which causes duplication of tasks during its operation, although this problem does not affect the file where the tasks are saved.

<!-- WARNING BROKEN CODE -->
> **Warning**
It is not uncommon for me to commit broken code. Also I don't guarantee this setup to be stable
or the slightest bit safe for use. You have been warned.

<!-- MASSIVE REFACTOR -->
> **Important**
Massive refactor of how numbers are handled. As things currently are, I made a pretty
big mistake where I performed a **shit ton** of arithmetic/logical operations through out
the config, which in turn causes it to be extremely unstable and prone to crashing. I am
currently working on fixing this, and so the configuration is currently undergoing pretty
fundamental changes. If you were here considering to try it out, I would like to ask you
not to, at least not for the time being.


<!-- INFORMATION -->
## Hello! Thanks for coming! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
These are my configuration files for **AwesomeWM** called **Strangyu**, which includes a
user configuration file, a repositionable bar and titles (with animation), a control center,
a dashboard with shortcuts for popular pages, notifications, screenshot tools,
interactive calendar, multiple color schemes.
  
The results shown in the pictures can be achieved
changing just a few variables in the `userconf.lua` file.


## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Features of config
- **WM:** [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) 
- **Operating system:** [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download/)
- **Terminal:** [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- **Shell:** [fish](https://fishshell.com/) 
- **Application Launcher:** [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) 
- **File Manager:** [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) 

<!-- SETUP -->
## üîß Setup

<details>
<summary><b>1. Install Required Dependencies</b></summary>

1. First of all you should install the Awesome-git.


    **Arch users** can use the [Awesome-git AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/awesome-git/).
    ```shell
    yay -S awesome-git
    ```

    In the case of **Fedora-based distributions**, it is necessary to install certain libraries before proceeding with the Awesome-git installation(Maybe some bookstore is too much, but hey, you better not miss that on xd).
    ```shell
    sudo dnf install xcb-util-devel xcb-util-keysyms-devel xcb-util-wm-devel 
    startup-notification-devel libxdg-basedir-devel xcb-util-xrm-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel xcb-cursor-devel 
    make automake gcc gcc-c++ cmake glib2-devel gdk-pixbuf2-devel cairo-devel libX11-devel xcb-util-cursor-devel 
    xcb-util-devel xcb-util-keysyms-devel xcb-util-wm-devel libxkbcommon-devel cairo-devel xcb-util-image-devel 
    libstartup-notification-devel libxdg-basedir-devel xcb-util-xrm-devel libxcb-devel lua-devel cmake 
    startup-notification-devel libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel libxdg-basedir-devel xcb-util-xrm-devel
    ```

    Once we have completed the prerequisites, we proceed to follow the Awesome-git build instructions found [here](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/#building-and-installation).

2. Installation of dependencies

<!-- INSTALL STRANGYU -->
<summary><b>2. Install Strangyu</b></summary>



1. Clone this repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/osmarmora05/dotfiles.git
      ```

2. Install my AwesomeWM configuration files

    > **Note**
    Before proceeding with the installation, it is recommended that you have the `kitty` terminal installed. If you already have a preferred terminal, you can modify the terminal variable inside the `userconf.lua` file.

    If you want just my AwesomeWM configuration

    ```shell
    cd dotfiles
    cp -r config/awesome/* ~/.config/
    ```
    
    Or if you want all the configuration

    ```shell
    cd dotfiles
    cp -r config/* ~/.config/
    ```
    **Optional** - Now if you want to get the source from the repository

    ```shell
    cd dotfiles
    cp -r misc/fonts/* /usr/share/fonts/
    ```

    Congratulations, at this point you have installed Strangyu! üéâ

    Log out from your current desktop session and log in into AwesomeWM

> **Warning**
If you are a user not familiar with programming, and mainly in lua, I recommend that you skip this part.

If you want to modify the todo-panel shortcuts, you can go to the `ui/themer-panel/modules/quicklinks.lua` file. In this file, you'll find this code snippet that you can edit to customize the shortcuts.

```lua
create_button("Û∞ëç", 'https://www.reddit.com/', beautiful.red,beautiful.gry),
create_button("Û∞ñ£", 'https://web.whatsapp.com/', beautiful.grn,beautiful.gry),
create_button("Û∞âé", 'https://drive.google.com/drive/', beautiful.cya,beautiful.gry),
create_button("Û∞ä§", 'https://github.com/osmarmora05', beautiful.wht,beautiful.gry),
create_button("Û∞ä´", "https://mail.google.com/", beautiful.blu,beautiful.gry),
```

Inside the `create_button` function, the first parameter is the icon of the shortcut, which you can get [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) . The second parameter is the URL that the shortcut should point to. **It is recommended not to modify the rest of the code and not to add or remove shortcuts.**


If you want to change the themer-panel messages, you can go to the `ui/themer-panel/modules/quote.lua` file. In this file, you'll find a code snippet that you can edit to customize the messages.

```lua
local quotes = {
  {
    quote = "He that can have patience can have what he will",
    author = "Benjamin Franklin"
  },
  {
    quote = "The question is not who is going to leave me; is who is going to stop me.",
    author = "Ayn Rand"
  },
  {
    quote = "Life would be so much easier if could just look at the source code",
    author = "Dave Olsen"
  },
  {
    quote = "Work hard in silence and let your success make all the noise.",
    author = "Frank Ocean"
  }
}

```
The code defines a table called `quotes` that contains a list of `quotes`. Each quote is represented by a table element, which is itself a table with two fields: `quote` (the message itself) and `author` (the author of the message).

You can modify the content of the `quotes` table to change the messages. In the `quote` field, you can write the message you want to display in the todo-panel. It is recommended that the message does **not exceed 85 characters** to ensure that it is displayed correctly on the panel. In the `author` field, you can write the author of the message. It is recommended that the author have **no more than 15 characters**.

It is important to note that **it is recommended not to modify the rest of the code and not to add or remove elements from the `quotes` table to avoid possible errors**.
